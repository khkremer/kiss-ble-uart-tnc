## Hardware

The code is compatible with the ESP32. Use ESP32 DevKit, Wroom or other boards with native BLE support.

## HowTo

- Install Arduino IDE [https://www.arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc)
- Install the ESP32 libraries. Follow this guide [https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html#installing-using-boards-manager](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html#installing-using-boards-manager)
- Download this sketch
- Flash sketch to ESP32 board
- Connect your TNC via 3.3V UART pins RX-GPIO16, TX-GPIO17 (with Arduino-like TNC use voltage divider to avoid problems with 5V non-tolerant inputs of ESP)
- Connect APRS.FI application via *Select TNC or software modem* choose *Aprs.fi TNC* in *BLE TNC discovered*
